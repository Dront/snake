Simple snake game
================

The name says it all.
Just trying out the PyGame lib.

## TODO:

1) New fruit may appear just under the snake. Fix.

2) A few fruits may appear on field at the same time.

2) Load maps from file. For now, it's just the hardcoded default map.

3) Refactor like half of the code.

4) Use more PyGame features, like sprites and groups for collision handling.

5) Add some nice pictures instead of those creepy colored rectangles.

6) Introduction and options screen.

7) Saving records and options.

9) All other ideas.

## DONE:

Basic game is ready.
